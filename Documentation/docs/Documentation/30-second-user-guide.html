<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Most of the commands have a Log and a Debug variant. The Log version always works. The Debug version only works in debug builds, and does nothing in release builds.</p>

<p>Before you can log to a channel, you need to define it:</p>

<pre><code>ECDefineLogChannel(SomeChannel);
ECDefineDebugChannel(AnotherChannel);
</code></pre>

<p>Logging something to a channel is very like NSLog, except that you also pass the channel in:</p>

<pre><code>ECLog(SomeChannel, @"some text %d", someInt);
ECDebug(AnotherChannel, @"my array looks like this %@", someArray);
</code></pre>

<p>You can also log arbitrary objects, for example:</p>

<pre><code>NSImage* image = [NSImage imageNamed:@"image.png"];
ECDebug(AnotherChannel, image);
</code></pre>

<p>The default log handlers deal with arbitrary objects by logging their description, but custom handlers can do more clever things like actually displaying images.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>Configuration information is stored using NSUserDefaults, so that you can change channel and handler settings during a debug session and they will remain the same next time.</p>

<p>Initial values are loaded from an ECLogging.plist (or ECLoggingDebug.plist) file, which you add to your app. If this file is missing, a basic NSLog-based log handler will be registered with the system so that you still get to see some output.</p>

<p>Channels generally default to off, so that the log isn&rsquo;t spammed.</p>

<p>You can turn individual channels on:</p>

<ul>
<li>using supplied UI classes that you can add to your app&rsquo;s debug builds</li>
<li>in the ECLogging.plist file</li>
<li>using ECEnableChannel&copy; / ECDisableChannel&copy; in code</li>
</ul>


<p>Using the UI is the best way, since the changes will only apply to the machine you&rsquo;re on (so each user can enable a different set of channels).</p>

<h2>Release Builds</h2>

<p>ECDebug channels compile out completely for release builds, so anything in an ECDebug() call doesn&rsquo;t happen in release.</p>

<p>ECLog calls don&rsquo;t &ndash; this allows you to leave some logging in to your release, default it to off, but allow a user to turn it on to help you track down bugs.</p>

<p>Default settings are read from ECLogging.plist in release builds, or from ECLoggingDebug.plist (if it exists) in debug builds &ndash; thus you can have different defaults for either.</p>

<p>There are some basic log handlers: ECLogHandlerNSLog, ECLogHandlerStdOut, etc. You can write log handlers to do more interesting things. You could integrate with asl, or log4j. You could send the log output to a socket. You could keep it in memory and display it in a UIView, or email it back to yourself after the user gave you permission. And so on&hellip;</p>
