					<p>A <strong>channel</strong> is a place to send log messages to.</p>

<p>You get to define as many channels as you like, organised in whatever way makes sense.</p>

<p>This allows you to turn most logging off most of the time, and just enable the bits that you happen to be interested in right now.</p>

<h2>Log and Debug</h2>

<p>Channels come in two flavours, log and debug.</p>

<p>Log channels are always available.</p>

<p>Debug channels are only available in debug targets (ones where EC_DEBUG is defined). In non-debug builds, debug channels don&rsquo;t exist. Anything inside ECDebug() messages won&rsquo;t get compiled or executed at all. This allows you to put potentially time-consuming logging code into these calls, safe in the knowledge that it won&rsquo;t affect the final performance of your app.</p>

<h2>Defining Channels</h2>

<p>Channels must be defined before use. This is done once for each channel, in a .m file. For example:</p>

<pre><code>ECDefineLogChannel(MyLogChannel);
ECDefineDebugChannel(MyDebugChannel);
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to share a channel between multiple files, you can also declare it in a .h file:</p>

<pre><code>ECDeclareLogChannel(MyLogChannel);
ECDeclareDebugChannel(MyDebugChannel);
</code></pre>

<h2>Using Channels</h2>

<p>To use a channel, you send stuff to it with ECLog or ECDebug:</p>

<pre><code>ECLog(MyLogChannel, @"this is a test %@ %d", @"blah", 123);

ECDebug(MyDebugChannel, @"doodah");
</code></pre>

<p>As mentioned above, ECLog statements will always be compiled, so you need to use them with channels defined by ECDefineLogChannel.</p>

<p>You can use ECDebug with channels that were defined with either ECDefineLogChannel or ECDefineDebugChannel. Any ECDebug statements will be compiled in debug builds, but not in release builds.</p>

<h2>Logging Objects</h2>

<p>As well as the more usual text logging, you can also send arbitrary objects to a log channel.</p>

<pre><code>NSImage* image = [NSImage imageNamed:@"blah.png"];
ECDebug(MyLogChannel, image);
</code></pre>

<p>What the log handlers do with objects that you log is up to them. The default behaviour for simple text-based log handlers is just to call [object description] on the object and log that.</p>

<p>However, custom log handlers can do anything that they want. For example, you might have a log handler which takes any images that you log and displays them in a scrolling window.</p>
